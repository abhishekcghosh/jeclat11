                The old skin of wind-clear scales dropping<br />
                Upon my open palm<br />
                Soothing my nerves making me calm<br />
                This... the shadow... projects the tree<br />
                Upward causing the sun to shine in his sphere.<br />
                But down there on the road, by the river... every inch... every dro ... that April<br />
                That we first went with our stiff lusts<br />
                Leaving the life behind, out to the crushing world —<br />
                May, they said she was. A hand for all of us:<br />
                This branch of blue butterflies tied to this stem.<br />
                But again... this March.. hands will join and caress the gem<br>
                Celebrations will begin... "Irina" thy name! <br />

            	Life with all its twists and turns, always unfolding, has so much to offer, 
                like the meandering of a river. Sometimes sublime sometimes pathetic. 
                But, quite often we, unable to cope up with the crash and burn succumb to its misgivings. 
                But, however we intend to take a leap out of this ever engrossing book and look up to the best of times. 
                To get nostalgic about the times of celebration, to reminisce about the onset of a journey and to experience a strong sense of déjà vu all it takes is a moment of deep joy. 
                And "Irina" endeavors to do just the same. And to do that without losing its bearings.
